p4 = Player("p4")
p5 = Player("p5")
p6 = smarterPlayer("sp6")

#create table
aTable = table()
aTable.setMaxGames(1000)

#adding players
aTable.addPlayer(p1,100)
aTable.addPlayer(p2,100)
aTable.addPlayer(p3,100)
aTable.addPlayer(p4,100)
aTable.addPlayer(p5,100)
aTable.addPlayer(p6,100)

print("Table Setted up with Six dummy player")
print("Number of Players " + str(aTable.getNPlayer()))
print("Number of Active Players " + str(aTable.getNPlayer_active()))
print("Number of inGame Players " + str(aTable.getNPlayer_inGame()))

#run the game
aTable.runGame()
```
