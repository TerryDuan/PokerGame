    2. call startGame() on each players in the list, from 0 to END, pass hands and position to each player(agent)
    3. while no winner or before MAX_ITERATION:
        (if street == PreFlop, start from position 2, else start from position 0)
        3a. call player_i.action(), pass through latest updated thisGameActions{}
        3b. update returned tuple into thisGameActions{}
        3c. update table.pot
        3d. if all players checks/called, move to next street, or call find_winner()
        3e. if player is out and inactive, remove it from the playersList
