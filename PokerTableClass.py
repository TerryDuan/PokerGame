Table class is used to track and drive the game
pot: pot for each game, reset to zero after each game, give pot to winner by player.endGame()
PlayersList: list to store players, [SB, BB, UTG, UTG+1, HJ, CO, BTN], Player at position 0 will be moved to end of list as new BTN

while not end:

    1. check if enough active player, else BREAK
    2. call startGame() on each players in the list, from 0 to END, pass hands and position to each player(agent)
    3. while no winner or before MAX_ITERATION:
        (if street == PreFlop, start from position 2, else start from position 0)
        3a. call player_i.action(), pass through latest updated thisGameActions{}
        3b. update returned tuple into thisGameActions{}
        3c. update table.pot
        3d. if all players checks/called, move to next street, or call find_winner()
        3e. if player is out and inactive, remove it from the playersList
